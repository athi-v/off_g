                    <p class="font-normal h-[20px] pt-[50px] w-full md:w-[400px]">A word from Professor Jacqueline Arendse</p>
                    <p class="font-extralight pt-[80px] lg:w-[831px]">Offshore investing offers exciting prospects to, but for many individual investors it involves moving into a large and unknown wilderness. <br/><br/>
Offshore investing is a vast topic and requires careful analysis because inasmuch as there are some tantalising opportunities, the landscape is complex, the range of opportunities extensive, and there are many areas of risk that could easily trap the unwary. A myriad of factors must, therefore, be considered by potential investors, and it is difficult to obtain a clear understanding in one take. <br/><br/>
This Guide provides that clarity, and is an important and relevant work. Running at more than 300 pages, it is a valuable response to the need for knowledge, offering extensive assistance to investors contemplating offshore investments, and those who are already in the offshore market but need certainty within the local and foreign legislative, exchange control and regulatory regime. With so much useful information in one place, it can be used time and again to review and refresh one&rsquo;s understanding in the course of navigating the offshore journey. <br/><br/> 
The authors&rsquo; collective ability is evident when considering how they have tackled this vast and complicated topic, explaining it in ways that a non-financial reader can understand. The Guide takes a logical and pragmatic approach that enables the reader to progressively build the knowledge base they will need when making their investment decisions together with their investment advisors. <br/><br/>
Offshore investing is no longer the exclusive domain of the super-wealthy. Indeed, investing offshore has become more accessible to a broader range of investors since the start of exchange control relaxations in the 1990s and is now an important consideration in any South African investment portfolio. Reasons for investing offshore are many and vary according to individual and family circumstances, but in the main, the exponential growth in this sector has been motivated by some of the following:<br/><br/>
Concerns about the local economy and the continued devaluation of the Rand.
The need to diversify and spread risk in a portfolio: This may apply in terms of currency exposure and the types of investments within a portfolio.
The opportunity to access other markets, including innovative and technological companies that aren&rsquo;t listed in South Africa. <br/><br/>
Keeping a spread of investments in other geographical areas: South Africa is remote from the major economies and markets; comprises less than 1% of the global economy; and there are fewer than 500 companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) compared to several thousand as is the case with other bourses.<br/><br/>
Preserving wealth and maintaining value by linking investments to foreign currencies such as the US Dollar, which is critical for maintaining retirement savings as well as providing a legacy for future generations.<br/><br/>
Investing abroad in anticipation of relocating in the future, or planning and providing for family members that have already relocated. <br/><br/>
In the course of completing the research for my PhD Thesis entitled &lsquo;An investigation into the introduction of a new wealth tax in South Africa&rsquo; [Rhodes University, 2018], I interviewed a range of high net worth South Africans. Almost all of the interviewees expressed strong concerns about government corruption, which not only contributed to an increasing unwillingness on the part of wealthy individuals to contribute more by way of taxes, but also provided strong motivation to move wealth offshore. Many South Africans across the board are of the same sentiment and the motivation to invest offshore has certainly gained momentum in recent years. <br/><br/>
But, before taking a leap into the unknown, it is essential for an investor to understand the offshore investment landscape, and this is where this Guide will add tremendous value to a reader.<br/><br/>
I congratulate the well-qualified authors on an excellent reader-friendly and practical body of work, and I am sure this Guide will be an indispensable resource to advisors and investors alike for years to come.<br/><span><br/><b>Professor Jacqueline Arendse</b></span><br/>

She is currently the Head of Tax at Academic One, a new tertiary institution which is developing an online post-graduate programme for aspiring accountants. Professor Arendse continues to present regular tax training for accountants, tax practitioners and corporates.<br/><br/><span><b>A word from Lelané Bezuidenhout &mdash; Financial Planning Institute of Southern Africa</b></span><br/><br/>
Financial planning is, by definition, a multi-disciplinary process and involves the identification and analysis of complex needs and the design of appropriate solutions with global consideration. A competent professional advisor needs to be equipped with a range of complementary skills and global knowledge in diverse fields such as tax, risk, investment, retirement, and estate planning, as well as wealth and personal risk management, and employee benefits consulting.<br/><br/>
The Financial Planning Institute of Southern Africa (FPI) is an affiliate of the Financial Planning Standard Board, and which has the primary objective to establish the financial planning profession globally and to set standards of ethical and technical competence for Certified Financial Planners. <br/><br/>
The FPI is therefore committed to the maintenance and application of stringent academic standards for professional competency examinations  and ongoing educational requirements. Part of the cornerstone of the FPI being able to deliver quality education, includes the availability of suitable literature. The Practical Guide to Offshore Investments as such,  is therefore considered an invaluable resource, for both members of the Institute and the broader investment public.<br/><br/>
The FPI recommends this publication an essential read for all financial planners, especially in South Africa, and commends the authors on producing The Practical Guide to Offshore Investments 2022/3.<br/><br/><span><b>Lelané Bezuidenhout, CFP&reg;</b></span><br/>
