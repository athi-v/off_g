Exchange controls:</b><br/>
There is currently no indication that exchange controls will be completely abolished. Indeed, given the amount of money that has left the country, many commentators are concerned that exchange controls may be reimposed.  <br/><br/>
Vast numbers of South Africans have utilised their exchange control allowances to invest in the offshore marketplace, favouring the direct investment mechanism. The mechanism that pre-dated the direct offshore allowance was rand-denominated, also known at that time as asset swap investments owing to the need for an asset swap partner to facilitate an investment with a South African financial services provider.  Exchange controls are covered in substantial detail in this Guide.<br/><br/><b>Tax considerations:</b><br/>
The South African tax dispensation has massively transformed over the past two decades and complex legislation was introduced over succeeding years to deal with factors such as:<br/><br/> <span class="pl-[50px]">
                            &bull; Foreign dividends.<br/> </span><span class="pl-[50px]">

     &bull; Foreign currency conversions.<br/> </span><span class="pl-[50px]"> 
    &bull; Transfer pricing.<br/> </span><span class="pl-[50px]"> 
    &bull; Anti-avoidance.<br/><br/> </span> 
With the change in SARS management and policies has come a laser focus on taxation. Consequently, understanding taxation is of vital importance, which will always need to be factored into investment considerations regardless of whether investment is onshore or offshore.<br/><br/>
Income tax and capital gains tax, and relevant  changes, are presented in Chapters 2, 3 and 4 of the Guide.<br/><br/>
Offshore investment vehicles,  Rand and international performances Offshore investments provide an opportunity to spread risk. Gone are the days when only multi-millionaires could afford to invest offshore given that entry levels have come down dramatically. Offshore trusts were regularly used as part of an investment strategy but this tendency has waned and correctly so as, in the main, only those with inter-generational strategies should consider setting up offshore trusts. <br/><br/>
If the spreading of risk is the point of departure, the daily fluctuations of the rand will not be concerning. However, whilst the rand has, at times, proven to be resilient, in the medium- to long-term the trend has been downward against the major global hard currencies.<br/><br/>
What should also be considered as part of the investment evaluation process, is the move from analogue to digital. Subject to advice, this impacts on sectors and investment types. The rise of digital currencies is also playing a role, as is the strengthening focus on Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) where ethical investing is an increasingly important consideration, hence its inclusion in this Guide
These topics are covered extensively in this Guide.<br/><br/><b>Performance of international markets</b><br/>
The years following the relaxation of exchange controls present interesting statistics, especially when comparing the performance of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) with the performance of international indices &mdash;  in this case The Morgan Stanley Capital Index (MSCI). The JSE may have performed well occasionally but the SA economy and financial markets (rand, JSE) have overall, experienced a decade of underperformance relative to the rest of the world. Over the past five years, the collapse of growth is now felt across virtually all portfolios linked to the JSE. <br/><br/>
Equity portfolios on the JSE have also, on average, not produced any growth over the past five years. Strip out Naspers &mdash; basically a foreign company &mdash; and the balance of the JSE listings show a negative return of between 10-25% over this period. The performance of the JSE All-Share Index over the past decade has shown a decline in annual returns.<br/><br/>
It compares with MSCI returns of, on average, 12-15% in rand terms. This trend appears to reflect ever-diminishing real returns over 10 years, and over the past five years, negative returns. 
This scenario exists despite the stellar performance of global media and internet company Naspers, which at one time represented some 22% of the market capitalisation of the JSE. Stripping out the performance of Naspers, the returns would have looked even worse. Few mid- and small cap shares have made any money for investors over the past 5-7 years, and worse, when repriced into US dollars, the JSE has presented no real return. Since the market peak in December/January 2018, the JSE has, in fact, lost 58% in US dollar terms.<br/><br/><b>Covid-19</b><br/>
Covid-19 has significantly changed the arena of international families, and its unprecedentedness has had paralytic effects as a disruptor. The pandemic and its effects have become such an overarching daily topical issue that it does not warrant detailed comment per se.<br/><br/>
However, what does warrant attention is its impact on remote working and the realisation that individuals can perform with less formalised structure than previously believed. The abrupt introduction of lockdown and its various levels has also limited access to entertainment and leisure activities, leaving individuals with more leisure and &lsquo;thinking&rsquo; time. This has provoked much introspection, including the status of investment portfolios. <br/><br/>
Limitations on travel and curfews have impeded the extent to which people have been able to move and interact with others. Notwithstanding online communication, humans are social creatures that have been forced into a new era that dictates how we connect.<br/><br/>
This is changing not just family dynamics, but working lives too, largely defined by who is best able to do what. This is likely to manifest in the emergence of new types of leadership with objectives defined differently and driven by more clearly defined purpose. We may even revert to the type of thinking last seen at the time of the Second World War where objectives were reprioritised as country, business and family before individual.<br/><br/> 
Exactly how Covid-19 will shape international families and the way they interact with their environment remains to be seen, particularly in light of all the other changes that have impacted over the past 20 years, some of which are noted and explored in this Guide. What this disruptor has proven, is that investors are very adaptive when they have adequate information to guide them. <br/><br/><b>Jurisdictional changes and taxation</b><br/>
Over many decades, global families have enjoyed confidentiality in their wealth and transactional dealings. This has changed with the introduction of several measures that undermine client confidentiality, motivated by governments or international organisations such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Financial Action Task Force, and the European Union. These measures are reviewed in this Guide as they represent a challenge to investors, and even to the extent that they do not, they are still interwoven into the fabric of life and have to be considered in determining the effectiveness of an offshore investment.
The international planning landscape has changed to such an extent that the decision where to live and where to do business and invest, may have serious consequences for the family or individual involved, thus careful planning in advance is an absolute essential. <br/><br/>
Practical examples are provided throughout this publication. It is emphasised as wise to compile a checklist of influencers before selecting a jurisdiction in which to operate.<br/><br/>
Tax is examined in more detail in Chapters 2, 3 and 4.<br/><b><br/>
Common Reporting Standard (CRS)</b><br/>
From an investor&rsquo;s perspective, tax is just one element to be considered as part of broader offshore planning. The advent of the OECD&rsquo;s Common Reporting Standard (CRS) is, perhaps, a greater challenge given it is against a background of increased tax transparency with the objective of preventing tax evasion. The gist of it is the automatic exchange of information between countries without reference to the taxpayer concerned. This aligns to the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), which is focused on US citizens, with reference to US passport or green card holders. <br/><br/>
CRS commenced in 2017 for some 94 early participating countries, with many more joining the following year. Most nations in the world are now reporting on individuals whose banking and investments are held in their own names but outside their country of residence. <br/><br/>
In addition, these countries are reporting settlors and protectors of international trusts, beneficiaries who receive a distribution in the relevant year, company shareholders, and loans to trusts or companies. The exchange of information has now become exceptionally transparent with significant flows of information being passed to and from overseas authorities. It is necessary therefore to understand CRS, how it works, and how to operate within its parameters.<br/><br/>
Further transparency related to the offshore affairs of international individuals and families is also evident with the introduction of beneficial ownership registers. This follows the 2016 Jersey government&rsquo;s decision to enhance the effectiveness of sharing company beneficial ownership information on a bilateral basis between the UK and participating jurisdictions.<br/><br/>
These include: the other two Crown Dependencies; six British Overseas Dependencies with IFCs, inclusive of Guernsey, Alderney, and the Isle of Man; and the six British Overseas Territories (OTs) with IFCs, namely Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. <br/><br/>
It is important to note the various initiatives towards transparency in the international financial services environment, as they affect the way investors will operate in the future, and who will need to be mindful of the ultimate full transparency en route.<br/><br/><b>Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)</b><br/>
Domestic Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS), an OECD initiative, may not be directly applicable to international families and family offices. However, it may have an indirect impact on those having an involvement in multinational enterprises. This is because BEPS is centred around ending multinational enterprises&rsquo; exploitation of gaps and mismatches in tax rules, to avoid paying tax. <br/><br/>
Some 135 countries are collaborating internationally to combat this by implementing 15 actions to tackle tax avoidance, improve the coherence of international tax rules, and ensure a more transparent tax environment.<br/><b><br/>
Economic substance</b> <br/>
The EU has sought to introduce economic substance requirements to IFCs. This is premised on alleged concerns around offshore entities generating too much profit and too little substance in low or zero-rate tax jurisdictions. As a result, many IFCs have introduced substance legislation, including all the traditional offshore jurisdictions such as Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Anguilla, Bahamas and Bermuda.<br/><br/>
The majority of these jurisdictions gave a commitment to the EU to introduce substance requirements, and successfully passed legislation before the 2018 year-end deadline, as well as providing guidance around the application of such legislation. <br/><br/>
In March 2019 and with a subsequent review in May that year, the EU published an updated list, moving those jurisdictions that had reached the requisite standard off the list, or onto a greylist or blacklist depending on their respective progress. <br/><br/>
As a result, the majority of these jurisdictions have since adapted their local substance legislations and provided additional guidance on economic substance requirements. Failure to do so may have grave consequences, such as incurring significant fines or companies struck off local registries.<br/>
Economic substance is an important factor to consider before setting up an offshore company. <br/><br/>
Factors that influence individual jurisdictions are varied, including whether the relevant company is in scope or out of scope. In the former, additional tax reporting requirements apply. It is anticipated that the level of regulation around in scope companies will increase and eventually these companies will have to demonstrate economic substance or pay increased costs, which may include some levy or tax.<br/><br/><b>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) </b><br/>
The level of transparency created by CRS at an international level, and also across IFCs with beneficial ownership registers, stands in contrast to the level of privacy protection established by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  Admittedly, the bodies seeking and holding information are different, as are the purposes for holding the information. <br/><br/>
The basis for the GDPR is rooted in the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights. It provides under Article 8, which relates to personal privacy, that &apos;Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence&apos;. On this basis, the European Union has sought to ensure the protection of this right through legislation. <br/><br/>
It is worth taking the time to comprehensively review the GDPR, as the ramifications for breaching can be far-reaching and costly. <br/><br/>
The offshore investment opportunity Most investment and financial advisers are in agreement that investors are currently presented with exceptional opportunities to invest in foreign hard currency and offshore investment vehicles at relatively cheap prices. <br/><br/>
Now, more than ever, is the time to include offshore investments in an investment portfolio. Regardless of rand fluctuations and the performance of international markets, the cornerstone of any investment philosophy should be based on diversification (spreading of risk), and offshore investment should be present in an investor portfolio. <br/><b><br/>
Dynamic environment</b><br/>
It has been widely punted that half of the world&rsquo;s transactions take place in IFCs, with more than a quarter of the world&rsquo;s wealth is in offshore trusts. This translates into an extremely dynamic environment that must be carefully considered during any investment planning process. <br/><br/>
Offshore structures are complex and a number of factors &mdash; among them income and capital gains tax, exchange control, estate planning &mdash; need to be considered. It must be emphasised that offshore investments usually only form part of an investment portfolio and the exact proportion allocated offshore would depend on, amongst other things, the risk profile of the investor. <br/><b><br/>
Objective of this Guide</b><br/>
The aim of this publication is to motivate prospective or current investors and financial advisers, to consider issues applicable to the offshore investment environment. This Guide is not intended to be academic in nature but rather to present practical solutions and serve as a reference for all interested parties, inclusive of advisors.<br/><br/>
Key issues are discussed such as: <br/><br/>
&bull; Income and capital gains tax implications.<br/>
&bull; The latest Budget provisions and recently introduced 2022/2023 tax changes, such as the new tax on loans to onshore and offshore trusts, and the tax on foreign dividends. <br/>
&bull; Exchange controls.<br/>
&bull; Offshore trusts, estate duty implications, and structuring of wills and estate planning.<br/>
&bull; The most prominent offshore jurisdictions utilised by South Africans.<br/>
&bull; Offshore products in general and specific products on offer.<br/>
&bull; A number of case studies have been included in the publication as practical examples, to assist understanding of the fairly technical chapters. <br/>
&bull; For those not conversant with the finer nuances of income tax regulations, the case studies should prove  most useful. <br/>
&bull; Chapters 2 and 3 are fairly technical. It is, therefore, recommended that the case studies be read first, or alternatively, consideration be given to specific tax sections in light of the offshore investment product selected (refer Chapter 14 of this Guide). This will obviate the need to consider the relevant income tax sections in detail. The transformation of the financial industry in recent years has prompted investors to become better educated about investment and financial matters.  <br/></p>
